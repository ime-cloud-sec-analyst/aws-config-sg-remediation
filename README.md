 Lab 7.1: Remediating an Incident by Using AWS Config and Lambda 
Summary and Walkthrough
Overview & Objectives
Goal: Use AWS Config to detect unauthorized changes to EC2 security-group inbound rules and automatically remediate them via a Lambda function.

Key Services: IAM, AWS Config, Amazon VPC Security Groups, AWS Lambda, CloudWatch Logs.

Outcome: Any change that opens ports beyond HTTP/HTTPS is automatically closed again.

Task 1: Examining & Updating IAM Roles
Inspect the AwsConfigLambdaSGRole inline policy.

What it does: Grants the Lambda function rights to describe and modify EC2 security-group rules and write CloudWatch logs.

Attach the AWS-managed AWS_ConfigRole policy to the AwsConfigRole role.

Why: Allows AWS Config to record configuration snapshots to S3 and read related resource metadata.

Troubleshooting: If you tried editing the inline JSON but saw an Access-Analyzer error, back out to the Roles ‚Üí AwsConfigRole page and use Add permissions ‚Üí Attach policies instead.

Task 2: Setting Up AWS Config
In AWS Config ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù:

Enable recording for Specific resource types ‚Üí AWS EC2 SecurityGroup at Continuous frequency.

Select the AwsConfigRole you prepared.

Verify: Wait for the ‚ÄúRecording is on‚Äù banner.

Inventory: On the Resources page, filter by Network & security ‚Üí AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup.

Common hiccup: If no resources appear, collapse the Aggregators menu, ensure you‚Äôre in the right region (us-west-2), and refresh after a few minutes.

Task 3: Simulating a Security Incident
In the VPC console, filter to Lab VPC ‚Üí Security groups ‚Üí select LabSG1.

Edit inbound rules: change HTTP to 0.0.0.0/0, then add HTTPS (443), SMTPS (465), IMAPS (993) all from Anywhere-IPv4.

Capture a screenshot showing all four rules.

You‚Äôre emulating an accidental or malicious opening of SMTPS/IMAPS that you don‚Äôt want.

Task 4: Creating a Custom AWS Config Rule
Copy the pre-provisioned Lambda ARN from the AWS Details panel.

In AWS Config ‚Üí Rules, click Add rule ‚Üí Create custom Lambda rule:

Function ARN: your copied ARN

Name: EC2SecurityGroup

Description: ‚ÄúRestrict inbound ports to HTTP and HTTPS‚Äù

Trigger: When configuration changes on AWS EC2 SecurityGroup

Parameter: debug = true

Save and wait (~2‚Äì3 minutes) for the initial ‚ÄúLast successful evaluation‚Äù to show Compliant with annotation ‚ÄúPermissions were modified.‚Äù

Tip: Hit the refresh icon if it stays on ‚ÄúNot available.‚Äù

Task 5: Verifying Remediation & Reviewing Code
Revisit LabSG1 in the VPC console:

Inbound rules now show only HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443), for both IPv4 and IPv6. SMTPS/IMAPS are gone.

In Lambda ‚Üí awsconfig_lambda_security_group ‚Üí Code:

Line 2: import boto3 (plus botocore, json).

Line 9: REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS array lists only port 80 and 443 rules (IPv4 & IPv6).

Line 117: describe_security_groups() fetches current rules.

Line 129: if debug: block to emit extra log output.

No edits required ‚Äî the function already enforces exactly your desired state.

Task 6: Checking CloudWatch Logs
In CloudWatch ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Log groups, click /aws/lambda/awsconfig_lambda_security_group.

Choose Search all log streams, filter for ‚Äúrevoking for‚Äù.

Expand a log event that shows lines like:

rust
Copy code
Revoking for sg-0ebfc0f7711197e63: port 465
Revoking for sg-0ebfc0f7711197e63: port 993
Screenshot one of these entries ‚Äî proof of auto-remediation.

Scope & Key Takeaways
Scope: Tracks only EC2 Security Groups in a single region, but could be extended to other resource types (RDS, IAM, etc.) or additional unwanted ports.

Significance: Demonstrates fully automated detection + remediation with no human intervention ‚Äî critical for rapid incident response.

Lessons Learned:

How AWS Config‚Äôs detective (configuration-change) mode can tie into corrective (Lambda) actions.

Importance of least-privilege IAM roles for both Config and Lambda.

How CloudWatch Logs serve as your audit trail for automated security enforcement.
